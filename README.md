To run the program call ./Spectrum path-to-run-file/run-file.txt, where in the run file (see examples folder for prototypes) the process must be specified by its incoming and outgoing legs and a basis for the process has to be given.
The program then calculates and gives out the soft matrix and colour change matrices for all possible gluon insertions between two legs.
